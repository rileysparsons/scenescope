SceneScope
==========

## Summary
SceneScope was my entree into software development back in the summer of 2013. I had the goal of developing an iPhone application that would allow my fellow students at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, CA navigate on and off campus. Although at first it was simply released as a static map of popular locations on and nearby campus, it was built up to include the approximate location of other users on the map. This allowed student to see where their peers were congregating at any point in time.
